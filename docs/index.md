## JESSICA: Junior Environment Science Student Information and Collaboration App

### How JESSICA Addresses the Challenges

**Water Quality - Gippsland Lakes**
JESSICA enables Citizen Scientists to learn about, and contribute to, Gippsland Lakes water quality research, helping provide answers to the Gippsland Lakes water quality. Users, such as students, can access local water quality data from linked APIS (through our Geo Index) and use them to conduct further study, such as its impact on flora and fauna.

**Skills Development - Life after School**
Participating in Citizen Science is a great way to develop valuable work skills. Through JESSICA, students will be encourage to develop research, observation, analytical, communication, and presentation skills, through the content they write and the images/videos they produce. These skills will be very helpful in preparing them for the workforce. In addition, JESSICA enables students to be connected to their local community, including environmental organisations, providing them exposure to learn about the environmental industry and its professions.

**Moreton Bay greening as we grow**
The story about Queensland high schoolers learning about koala research in collaboration with Griffiths University is inspirational for this project. Through JESSICA, students like them, and others, can contribute their findings to the wider community. They can also leverage on the linked geo data on koalas, and other relevant information, such as canopy cover, through JESSICA's Geo Data index. By making their content available to the whole JESSICA community (nationwide), it can help bring outside attention to the Moreton Bay region too.

**Discovering our regionâ€™s environment and biodiversity**
The story about a teenager discovering the rare jewel beetle is insiprational for this project. Through JESSICA, youth like him can to be encouraged to pursue Citizen Science. JESSICA's Geo Data Index makes it convenient for them to access relevant local data to help in their activities. The app's community makes it a shared/social experience. Citizen Science will help the youth of ACT be more mindful of issues around environment and biodiversity, and become better stewards of nature.

**How can we beat Gamba Grass?**
A widespread threat like that of Gamba Grass needs the participation of every stakeholder of every age and background. In partnership with local schools and organisations, JESSICA can help support the formation of weed warrior groups, and encourage the youth to learn about, share insights on, and fight, weed threats like Gamba Grass. Through its Geo Data Index, it also makes accessing weed data convenient for the public.
