## JESSICA: Junior Environment Science Student Information and Collaboration App

### Description

Citizen Science is when the public voluntarily help conduct scientific research, and share results to organisations and the public. It's also a great way to get the youth engaged with the local community environment!

JESSICA stands for Junior Environmental Science Student Information and Collaboration App, and it is both a tool and a community to encourage in the participation of Citizen Science, engaging students with their local community and environmental organisations.

For example, schools and organisations can host activities in JESSICA such as:
- being weed warriors in NT, to learn about, and help in, the fight against Gamba Grass
- contribute to koala research in QLD
- finding and identifying rare species, such as the jewel beetle, in ACT
- study water quality and its effect on flora and fauna in Gippsland Lakes

By reading and posting content/media in JESSICA, they also get to practice valuable work skills such as research, observation, analysis, communication, and presentation skills. They also get to interact with the local environment industry and its professionals.

JESSICA, through its Geo Index App, aggregates vast scientific data available in various repositories, and make them accessible to the general public, by flagging relevant local information in close proximity.

For this project, we used Scratch as a prototyping tool. It is used by primary school kids to create interactive stories, animation, and games. For this hack, we used Scratch as a prototyping tool to conduct tests.

### How JESSICA Addresses the Challenges

**Water Quality - Gippsland Lakes**

JESSICA enables Citizen Scientists to learn about, and contribute to, Gippsland Lakes water quality research, helping provide answers to the Gippsland Lakes water quality. We are inspired by the story of primary school students in Otago, NZ, who help study the effects of dredging on their local marine life. Users, such as students, can access local water quality data from linked APIS (through our Geo Index) and use them to conduct further study, such as its impact on flora and fauna.

**Skills Development - Life after School**

Participating in Citizen Science is a great way to develop valuable work skills. Through JESSICA, students will be encourage to develop research, observation, analytical, communication, and presentation skills, through the content they write and the images/videos they produce. These skills will be very helpful in preparing them for the workforce. In addition, JESSICA enables students to be connected to their local community, including environmental organisations, providing them exposure to learn about the environmental industry and its professions.

**Moreton Bay greening as we grow**

The story about Queensland high schoolers learning about koala research in collaboration with Griffiths University is inspirational for this project. Through JESSICA, students like them, and others, can contribute their findings to the wider community. They can also leverage on the linked geo data on koalas, and other relevant information, such as canopy cover, through JESSICA's Geo Data index. By making their content available to the whole JESSICA community (nationwide), it can help bring outside attention to the Moreton Bay region too.

**Discovering our regionâ€™s environment and biodiversity**

The story about a teenager discovering the rare jewel beetle is insiprational for this project. Through JESSICA, youth like him can to be encouraged to pursue Citizen Science. JESSICA's Geo Data Index makes it convenient for them to access relevant local data to help in their activities. The app's community makes it a shared/social experience. Citizen Science will help the youth of ACT be more mindful of issues around environment and biodiversity, and become better stewards of nature.

**How can we beat Gamba Grass?**

A widespread threat like that of Gamba Grass needs the participation of every stakeholder of every age and background. In partnership with local schools and organisations, JESSICA can help support the formation of weed warrior groups, and encourage the youth to learn about, share insights on, and fight, weed threats like Gamba Grass. Through its Geo Data Index, it also makes accessing weed data convenient for the public.
